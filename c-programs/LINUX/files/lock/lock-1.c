/*
   The program first creates a file, opens it for both reading and writing, and then fills the file with data.
   It then sets up two regions: the first from bytes 10 to 30, for a shared (read) lock, and the second from
   bytes 40 to 50, for an exclusive (write) lock. It then calls fcntl to lock the two regions and waits for a
   minute before closing the file and exiting.

   On its own, this program isnâ€™t very useful. You need a second program to test the locks, lock2.c.
